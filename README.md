> ### ReScript + React codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://rescript-react-realworld-example-app.vercel.app) [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[ReScript & React](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **ReScript & React** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

Basically its just like React single-page-application but written in [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This is a Vite-based template with following setup:

- [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org) 11.0 with @rescript/react, [Core](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-core) and JSX v4
- ES6 modules (ReScript code compiled to `.bs.js` files)
- Vite 5 with React Plugin (Fast Refresh)
- Tailwind 3

# Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

```bash
gh repo clone bnse/rescript-react-realworld
cd rescript-react-realworld
bun i
bun res:dev
bun dev
```

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a production build with `bun run build` and you will find result in folder `/dist`, after you created a production build, you can execute `bun run preview` to serve the folder.
